The last time git local seemingly failed to delet local repos or
add remote repos so I decided to use the cloning approaching and
cloned this one.

So it appears now to updated things:
I add/commit locally.
Go to github repo Somehow 
Pull Requests > New Request
and create a pull request  
Then merge

This clone is on the Home directory
